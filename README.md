#### Lab 2-4 Requirements

	
#### Lab 2-4 Iteration Plan

	The following iteration plan contains the minimal features such that the starting grade (points) for each iteration is 10:
	
	Iteration 1 (deadline week 2):
	* two features (e.g: addStudent and printAllStudents)
	* java doc in html format (see the example from the group - project_root/doc/index.html - repository interface)
	* only inmemory repository is enough
	!!! Focus on working with git - working on only one branch (master/develop) is enough
	→ the project should be of type gradle

	Iteration 2 (deadline week 3):
	* three features
	!!! Focus on working with git - feature branches must be used
	→ the project must be of type gradle
	
	Iteration 3 (deadline week 4):
	* all features
