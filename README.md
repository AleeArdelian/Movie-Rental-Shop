	Problem P3


#### Problem Statement

	A movie rental shop manages information about movies and clients. Create an application which allows to:
	  * perform CRUD operations on movies and clients
	  * rent movies
	  * filter entities based on various criteria
	  * reports: e.g. find the most rented movie

#### Lab 2-4 Requirements

	Design the solution for your problem using a CASE tool (use cases, class diagram, sequence diagram for each use case)
	  * use feature driven development
	  * layered architecture 
	  * data validation
	  * all functions will be documented and tested

	Use Java 8 features (lambda expressions, streams etc); the program should be written without if statements and loops.
	Persistence: ‘in memory’, text files, xml, db (jdbc); you may use any RDBMS, but we only offer support for PostgreSQL; MS SQL Server is forbidden

	
#### Lab 2-4 Iteration Plan

	The following iteration plan contains the minimal features such that the starting grade (points) for each iteration is 10:
	
	Iteration 1 (deadline week 2):
	  * two features (e.g: addStudent and printAllStudents)
	  * java doc in html format (see the example from the group - project_root/doc/index.html - repository interface)
	  * only inmemory repository is enough
	  !!! Focus on working with git - working on only one branch (master/develop) is enough
	  → the project should be of type gradle

	Iteration 2 (deadline week 3):
	  * three features
	  !!! Focus on working with git - feature branches must be used
	  → the project must be of type gradle
	
	Iteration 3 (deadline week 4):
	  * all features
